        Step 1: Rotate the big car to find each view that you want to download. You can:
        -- Click and drag on the big car to rotate it.
        -- Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the big car.
        -- Use the scroll wheel to rotate the big car.
        -- Hold the shift button to rotate the car faster.
        Step 2: Once the big car is in a position you like, put the image in the
        shopping cart. You can:
        -- Click the "save view" button to put the current view in the cart.
        -- Double-click on the big car to put the current view in the cart.
        -- Press the enter button to put the current view in the cart.
        Step 3: When you've collected all the views you want to download, click
        the "download cart" button to download all images in the cart at once.
        If the big car image is not in the cart, it won't be downloaded.
