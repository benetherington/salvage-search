        <h1>Salvage Search v3</h1>

        <p>
            Salvage Search is a browser plugin that makes it easy to search
            inventory websites for vehicles and download high-def images.
        </p>

                        Interior 360 now lets you drag outside the window while
                        panning.

        <h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
        <p>
            This plugin adds an extension to your toolbar, and should be fairly
            self-explanatory. If you don't see the icon in your toolbar after
            installing: <b>In Chrome</b>: click the puzzle piece, then select
            Salvage Search. You can also click the pushpin to pin the icon to
            your toolbar. <b>In Firefox</b>: right-click on the toolbar, select
            "Customize Toolbar...", then drag the Salvage Search icon into the
            toolbar.
        </p>
        <img src="images/toolbar-popup.jpg" />
        <p>
            Type a VIN in the text box to enable the <b>Search button</b>.
            Notifications will appear as salvage yard inventories are searched.
            If a match is found, it will open in a new tab. If a vehicle cannot
            be found on those sites, the extension will also search archive
            sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            IAAI has recently disabled searching by VIN for users without am
            account. This extension will attempt to do a VIN search, but if IAAI
            returns a general terms search instead, no results will be
            displayed, and no error will be generated. Create an IAAI account
            and make sure you're logged in if you want to ensure that you can
            find vehicles in inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second button, the <b>Download Images button</b>, is enabled for
            vehicles at Copart and IAAI. When you click Download, the extension
            will fetch and download images for the vehicle. If the salvage yard
            has high resolution images (normally displayed when you click the HD
            button on their site), those will be downloaded instead of the
            standard resolution. If the salvage yard has exterior 360 or
            interior 360 images, new tabs will open to let you pick the views
            that you want to download.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to get the <b>Download Images button</b> to
            enable. You can type in a lot number and set the slider to Copart or
            IAAI. You can also click the Salvage Search button while you have a
            vehicle listing page open, and the fields will pre-fill for you.
            Image downloads are available for (as far as I can tell) every
            single vehicle at Copart and IAAI, even if they've been sold and are
            no longer listed on their websites. Available, that is, if you have
            a lot number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click the <b>GEAR BUTTON</b> to edit your settings, and enable or
            disable websites to search.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            This extension has become something I'm proud of! I've worked out a
            lot of bugs, but everyone uses their computer differently, and
            something might break. Salvage yard websites aren't designed to make
            this kind of thing easy, and they might change something without
            warning. If something doesn't work, or doesn't work the way you'd
            like, get in touch. Be sure to send me as much info as you can, and
            I'll see what I can do.

        <h2>REQUIRED PERMISSIONS</h2>
        <p>
            When you install the extension, it will ask for permissions. Here's
            what it's doing with them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Chrome)
                    <i>
                        Read and change your data on a number of websites (show
                        details) </i
                    >:
                </b>
                See below.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>(Firefox) <i>Access data on copart.com and iaai.com</i>:</b>
                Allows search requests to these websites. Allows images to be
                downloaded from these websites. Also allows scripts to be run on
                those pages to pre-fill the lot number box and the salvage yard
                slider.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i>Access data on avis.aai.com and spincar.com</i>:
                </b>
                Allows high resolution images and 360 image downloads from IAAI,
                which are accessed from a different domain than their inventory
                site.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i>
                        Access data on row52.com, poctra.com, and en.bidfax.info </i
                    >:
                </b>
                Allows search requests to these websites. Also allows scripts to
                be run on those pages to pre-fill the lot number box and the
                salvage yard slider.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox) <i>Get data from the clipboard</i> (Chrome)
                    <i>Read data you copy and paste</i>:
                </b>
                Allows the extension to pre-fill the VIN search field if you've
                already copied a VIN or lot number. This currenlty only works on
                Firefox.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i>
                        Download files and read and modify the browser's
                        download history
                    </i>
                    (Chrome)
                    <i> Manage your downloads </i>:
                </b>
                Allows the extension to send images to your downloads folder. We
                re-name images to eliminate a potential source of PII, and we
                don't require you to go through a dozen save-as dialogues. Your
                download history is not accessed or changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i> Access browser tabs </i>
                    (Chrome)
                    <i> Read your browsing history </i>:
                </b>
                Allows the extension to pre-fill the lot number box and the
                salvage yard slider from open tabs. This only happens on the
                websites above.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>PLANNED FEATURES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add extra salvage archive sites as they come and go. These
                archive sites aren't illegal, but do occasionally get shut down
                for one reason or another.
            </li>
        </ul>
