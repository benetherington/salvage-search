        <h1>Salvage Search v2</h1>

        <p>
            Salvage Search is a browser plugin that makes it easy to search
            inventory websites for vehicles and download high-def images. Select
            your browser below to install it.
        </p>

                        A major update! Most of the work is in reorganization
                        and stability improvements.

                        Adds exterior walkaround 360 and interior panorama 360
                        image captures. These are the two features I'm most
                        excited about!

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Quickly select the walkaround images that you want
                            with a shopping cart-like interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            View interior panoramas and get high resolution
                            captures. This involves some annoying 3D graphics
                            work: there are improvements to come, but it's
                            pretty functional as-is
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Adds panorama/walkaround downloads to Copart.</li>
                    <li>
                        Fixes IAAI downloads. It looks like they no longer serve
                        VIN search results, and they did a minor change to their
                        image information variable names.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adds a Copart/IAAI selector to the popup. If one is
                        selected when you click SEARCH, only that yard will be
                        searched. Importantly, this also allows you to specify a
                        yard to download images from. Previously, if Copart and
                        IAAI shared a lot number, the Copart images would be
                        downloaded, and the IAAI images ignored.

        <h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
        <p>
            This plugin adds an extension to your toolbar, and should be fairly
            self-explanatory. If you don't see the icon in your toolbar after
            installing: <b>In Chrome</b>: click the puzzle piece, then select
            Salvage Search. You can also click the pushpin to pin the icon to
            your toolbar. <b>In Firefox</b>: right-click on the toolbar, select
            "Customize Toolbar...", then drag the Salvage Search icon into the
            toolbar.
        </p>
        <img src="images/toolbar-popup.jpg" />
        <p>
            Type a VIN in the text box to enable the <b>Search button</b>.
            Notifications will appear as salvage yard inventories are searched.
            If a match is found, it will open in a new tab. If a vehicle cannot
            be found on those sites, the extension will also search archive
            sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            IAAI has recently disabled searching by VIN. This extension will
            attempt to do a VIN search, but if IAAI returns a general terms
            search instead, no results will be selected. As of v3.0, there are
            two archive sites that have fairly complete coverage of IAAI's
            current stock. In v3.1, a third archive site will be added. In the
            future, it may be neccessary for this extension to search IAAI by
            zip code, year, make, and model and present vehicles with a partial
            VIN match, but archive sites seem to be a more effective approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second button, the <b>Download Images button</b>, is enabled for
            vehicles at Copart and IAAI. When you click Download, the extension
            will fetch and download images for the vehicle. If the salvage yard
            has high resolution images (normally displayed when you click the HD
            button on their site), those will be downloaded instead of the
            standard resolution. If the salvage yard has exterior 360 or
            interior 360 images, new tabs will open to let you pick the views
            that you want to download.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to get the <b>Download Images button</b> to
            enable. You can type in a lot number and set the slider to Copart or
            IAAI. You can also click the Salvage Search button while you have a
            vehicle listing page open, and the fields will pre-fill for you.
            Image downloads are available for (as far as I can tell) every
            single vehicle at Copart and IAAI, even if they've been sold and are
            no longer listed on their websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click the <b>GEAR BUTTON</b> to edit your settings, and enable or
            disable websites to search.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            This extension has become something I'm proud of! I've worked out a
            lot of bugs, but everyone uses their computer differently, and
            something might break. Salvage yard websites aren't designed to make
            this kind of thing easy, and they might change something without
            warning. If something doesn't work, or doesn't work the way you'd
            like, get in touch. Be sure to send me as much info as you can, and
            I'll see what I can do.
        </p>

        <h2>REQUIRED PERMISSIONS</h2>
        <p>
            When you install the extension, it will ask for permissions. Here's
            what it's doing with them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Chrome)
                    <i>
                        Read and change your data on a number of websites (show
                        details) </i
                    >:
                </b>
                See below.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>(Firefox) <i>Access data on copart.com and iaai.com</i>:</b>
                Allows search requests to these websites. Allows images to be
                downloaded from these websites. Also allows scripts to be run on
                those pages to pre-fill the lot number box and the salvage yard
                slider.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i>Access data on avis.aai.com and spincar.com</i>:
                </b>
                Allows high resolution images and 360 image downloads from IAAI,
                which are accessed from a different domain than their inventory
                site.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i>
                        Access data on row52.com, poctra.com, and en.bidfax.info </i
                    >:
                </b>
                Allows search requests to these websites. Also allows scripts to
                be run on those pages to pre-fill the lot number box and the
                salvage yard slider.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox) <i>Get data from the clipboard</i> (Chrome)
                    <i>Read data you copy and paste</i>:
                </b>
                Allows the extension to pre-fill the VIN search field if you've
                already copied a VIN or lot number. This currenlty only works on
                Firefox.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i>
                        Download files and read and modify the browser's
                        download history
                    </i>
                    (Chrome)
                    <i> Manage your downloads </i>:
                </b>
                Allows the extension to send images to your downloads folder. We
                re-name images to eliminate a potential source of PII, and we
                don't require you to go through a dozen save-as dialogues. Your
                download history is not accessed or changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    (Firefox)
                    <i> Access browser tabs </i>
                    (Chrome)
                    <i> Read your browsing history </i>:
                </b>
                Allows the extension to pre-fill the lot number box and the
                salvage yard slider from open tabs. This only happens on the
                websites above.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>PLANNED FEATURES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <s>
                    Detect CAPTCHA requirements. Sometimes Copart requires a
                    CAPTCHA to do a search, but currently we don't detect when
                    that happens, leading to false negatives.
                </s>
                This should be taken care of! Please let me know if you
                encounter issues.
            </li>
            <li>Add extra salvage archive sites.</li>
